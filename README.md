Contains the codes for our AISTATS 2023 paper titled `Multi-Agent Congestion Cost Minimization with Linear Function Approximations'

The code works as follows:

1) Open the .py file in any python editor. 
2) Change the nunber of agents n to 2 or 3 or 4, etc. 
3) After completion of the current run, it will generate a data file that contains an arrayof size number of episides
4) Do multiple runs of the code, and take the average of the regrets yiu get at each run.

0 Finally, use a plotting function such as matlab to create the  greaph for other agents.
